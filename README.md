# Portfolio Application: Building a Robust Investment Tracker

This document outlines the design and functionalities of a stock portfolio application, empowering you to effectively track your investments.

**Key Features:**

- **Trade Management:**
    - Record buy and sell transactions for various stocks.
    - API Inputs:
        - UserAccountId (for user identification)
        - TradeType (Buy or Sell)
        - Quantity (number of shares)
        - StockID (unique identifier for the stock)
    - API Outputs:
        - Status (Success/Failure)
        - Message (explanatory details in case of failure)
- **Stock Details Retrieval:**
    - Fetch comprehensive information about a specific stock.
    - API Input:
        - StockID
    - API Output:
        - Stock Details:
            - Stock ID
            - Stock Name
            - Prices (Open, Close, High, Low, Settlement, etc.)
- **Portfolio Overview:**
    - Gain insights into your current holdings.
    - API Input:
        - UserID
    - API Output:
        - Holdings:
            - Stock Name
            - Stock ID
            - Quantity (shares held)
            - Buy Price (average cost per share)
            - Current Price (latest market price)
            - Gain/Loss (performance for each holding)
        - Portfolio Summary:
            - Total Portfolio Holding (aggregate market value)
            - Total Buy Price (overall cost of your investments)
            - Total Profit/Loss (net performance)
            - Profit/Loss Percentage (overall return on investment)
- **Stock Data Maintenance:**
    - Update stock information using a CSV file (e.g., NSE bhavcopy).
    - API Input:
        - CSV file containing stock details

**API Design Considerations:**

- **HTTP Methods:** Employ appropriate methods like POST (for trade execution) and GET (for data retrieval).
- **Endpoint Clarity:** Design well-defined and descriptive endpoints for each API function.
- **Robust Logic and Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive business logic to handle various scenarios and provide informative error messages.
- **Code Structure and Readability:** Maintain a clean and organized codebase for better maintainability.

**Phase 1 Implementation:**

- Live stock price updates are not included in this initial phase.

**Housekeeping API (Stock Data Update):**

- Leverages a CSV file (like NSE bhavcopy) to keep stock data current.
- Parses the CSV file to extract and process the data.
- Stores the updated stock information within the application.

**Future Enhancements (Phase 2 - Optional):**

- **Asynchronous Trade Execution:**
    - Introduce a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for handling trade orders asynchronously.
    - Trade API:
        - Accepts user input and pushes it to the message queue.
    - Consumer:
        - Retrieves trade orders from the queue and executes them.
    - Code Reusability: Maintain a unified codebase for both APIs.
    - Error Handling and Retries: Implement mechanisms to handle potential failures and retry logic for trade execution.
- **Automated Stock Data Updates:**
    - Schedule a task to download the CSV file daily.
    - Process the downloaded file to update stock data automatically.
- **Stock Search API:**
    - Implement a search functionality to find stocks based on their names.
    - API Input:
        - Search query (stock name)
    - API Output:
        - Matching Stock Details (comprehensive information for all stocks matching the search criteria)
    - Search Implementation: Choose a suitable search library or database depending on your project's requirements.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Security:** Incorporate security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Scalability:** Design the application with scalability in mind to accommodate future growth.
- **Testing:** Implement unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
